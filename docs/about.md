# About Dateno

Dateno is a next-generation dataset search engine that provides fast, comprehensive access to open datasets worldwide. Our mission is to make data discovery and integration as seamless as possible for researchers, analysts, developers, journalists, and anyone else working with data.

## Our Vision

We believe that access to data should be easy and efficient. By creating a powerful search engine specifically for datasets, we aim to accelerate research, innovation, and data-driven decision-making across various fields.

## What Sets Us Apart

1. **Speed**: We've optimized our search functionality to deliver results as quickly as possible using Meilisearch.
2. **Comprehensive Filtering**: Our advanced filtering system allows users to narrow down results by various parameters, making it easier to find exactly what you need.
3. **API-First Architecture**: (Coming soon) We're building Dateno with API access in mind, allowing for seamless integration into your workflows and applications.
4. **Extensive Index**: Our constantly growing index includes millions of records from thousands of data catalogs worldwide.
5. **Data Preservation**: We're committed to archiving datasets that are at risk of disappearing, ensuring valuable data remains accessible.

## How It Works

Dateno is built on the Common Data Index registry of data catalogs. We crawl various types of data sources, including:

- Open data portals
- Geoservers/geoportals
- Scientific data repositories
- Microdata catalogs
- Databases of indicators

We use common APIs and export formats like DCAT, CKAN API, CSW, WFS, WMS, and ArcGIS Rest API to gather data. After crawling, we enrich the data and convert it to a unified structure similar to DCAT, creating a single search index.

## Who We Are

Dateno is developed by APICrafter Development Ltd., based in Yerevan, Armenia, in collaboration with Open Data Armenia. Our team has been dedicated to open data for over a decade, and we're passionate about creating tools that make data more accessible and useful for everyone.

## Get Involved

We're always looking to improve Dateno and expand our index. If you have a data catalog you'd like to see included or have ideas for new features, please reach out to us at <dateno@dateno.io>.
